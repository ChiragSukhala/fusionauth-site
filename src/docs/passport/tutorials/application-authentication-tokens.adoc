== Application Authentication Tokens

In most cases, Users will authenticate using a login Id (email or username) plus a password. Passwords are hashed using a strong cryptographic
hash such as BCrypt. The process of hashing is intentionally show by design. In some cases, you might need a way to speed up authentication
but still want to ensure your data is secure.

To solve this problem, Passport supports the concept of Authentication Tokens. Authentication Tokens are an Application specific way of
authenticating Users. For each Application, you can enable Authentication Tokens and then allow Users to generate (or specify) a token that
will be used to authenticate them. These tokens are long sequences of characters and function similarly to API Keys. If you let Passport
generate them for you, they will be 30-45 characters in length and generated using a secure random mechanism.

=== Enabling Authentication Tokens

To enable Authentication Tokens, open the Passport Backend web interface and navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb]
[breadcrumb]#Applications# . Edit the Application you want to use Authentication Tokens for and click the Security tab. You'll see an option like this:

image::passport-authentication-token.png[Authentication Tokens,width=1200,role=shadowed]

Enable this option and save the change to your Application.

=== Generating Authentication Tokens

Once the Authentication Tokens are enabled for a specific Application, you can ask Passport to generate one for a User by creating or
updating a User Registration. To accomplish this, you will set the request parameter named `generateAuthenticationToken` to true in
the request JSON like this:

[.endpoint]
--
[method]#PUT# [uri]#/api/user/registration#
--

[source,json]
.Example Request JSON
----
include::docs/passport/src/json/user-registrations/create-request-with-authentication-token.json[]
----

This request will result in a response that includes an Authentication Token like this:

[source,json]
.Example Response JSON
----
include::docs/passport/src/json/user-registrations/response-with-authentication-token.json[]
----

For more information, review the link:../apis/registrations[User Registration APIs].

=== Authenticating Using a Token

Once a User has been given an Application specific Authentication Token, you can supply it on the link:../apis/login[Login API] as long as
you include the Application Id in the request as well. Here is an example request to the Login API:
