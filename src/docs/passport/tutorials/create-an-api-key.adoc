== Create an API Key

API Keys are used to authenticate API requests. Create as many API keys are you like, each one may be limited in ability to minimize security risk.

For example, the User API `/api/user` has four HTTP methods, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`. While each API may have different semantics, in a general sense you can think of these four HTTP methods as being retrieve, create, update and delete respectively. With that in mind, if you'd like to create an API key that can only retrieve users, you would limit the API key to the `GET` method on the `/api/user` API.

When you create an API key the key is defaulted to a secure random UUID but the API key is simply a string, so you may call it `super-secret-key` if you'd like. However UUIDs make a good API key in that they are unique and difficult to guess.

Once an API key has been created it may be used to make API calls. See link:../apis/authentication[API Authentication] for more information.
