== Overview

JSON Web Tokens (or JWT for short - pronounced "jot") is a standard defined as link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[RFC 7519] that
provides a portable unit of identity. Passport implements the JWT specification and can provide JWTs as part of the authentication workflows.

After a User is authenticated via the link:../apis/login[Login API] or link:../oauth/overview[OAuth], Passport creates a JWT and returns
it to the caller. This JWT will be cryptographically signed to allow other applications to verify that it was created by Passport.

== Configuring JWTs in Passport

Passport provides the ability to configure a couple of aspects of its JWT handling. By navigating to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb]
[breadcrumb]#System#  in the Passport
Backend web interface and selecting the JWT tab, you will see the global JWT configuration settings.

The following is an example screenshot of the global JWT configuration.

[.api]
.Form Fields
|===
|JWT issuer [default]#defaults to `inversoft.com`#
|This is the name that is placed into the JWT payload to identify the issuer. Generally this will be you company name or domain name. This value
will be used as the registered claim `iss` as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1[RFC 7519 Section 4.1.1].

|Refresh token duration [default]#defaults to `43200` or 30 days#
|The length of time in minutes a Refresh Toke is considered valid. See <<Refresh Tokens>> below for additional information.

|JWT duration [default]#defaults to `3600` or 1 hour#
|The length of time in seconds before a JWT expires.

|Signing algorithm [default]#defaults to `HMAC using SHA-256`#
|The algorithm used to sign JWTs issued by Passport. When an HMAC based algorithm is selected, the HMAC secret field will be required. When an
RSA based algorithm is selected the RSA public and private key fields will be required.

=== Configuring JWT Signing

Passport provides two levels of configuration for JWT signing, the global default values shown above, and then each Application has the option to
override these default values and define their own.

From the global JWT configuration page, you can configure the global JWT signing algorithm and keys. Passport supports configurations for HMAC
or RSA based signing algorithms.

==== RSA Signing

If you are using Passport in a hybrid environment where some applications are trusted while others are not, RSA signing is preferred. This allows
you to provide those applications with the RSA public key to verify the JWT signature while securing the RSA private key inside Passport.

This means that only one party holds the RSA private key can is able to produce a JWTs, this means it is easy to know for certain who issued
and signed the JWT.

==== HMAC Signing

On the other hand, if you are in a secure environment and you require better performance, HMAC is a better solution. The downside of using HMAC
signing is that each application that has access to the HMAC secret. Anyone with the secret can both produce a JWT with a valid signature
and verify the signature which makes it difficult to know for certain who issued and signed the JWT.

== Application Specific Configuration

If you navigate to `Settings` -> `Applications`, you can also configure the JWT parameters, including the signing algorithm, on a per
application basis. If you don't select to enable Application specific JWT configuration, the global algorithm configuration will be used.

The following is an example screenshot of an Application specific JWT configuration.

== Login and JWTs

When you complete a request to the link:../apis/login[Login API], Passport will return a JWT in the JSON response body as well as in an HTTP
Only session cookie. The cookie has the benefit of allowing web applications to authenticate directly against Passport and managing JWT
identities through the browser. The cookie name that the JWT is returned in is called `access_token`.

Here is an example of this `Set-Cookie` response header that includes a JWT with line breaks and spaces for readability.

The JSON response body will also contain the JWT in an attribute called `token` like this:

=== Skipping JWT Creation

There are some circumstances where you don't need a JWT returned as part of the link:../apis/login[Login API] response and therefore you can
instruct Passport to omit the JWT from the response. This will reduce the latency of calling the link:../apis/login[Login API] because Passport can skip the creation and signing of the JWT. To disable JWTs during authentication, supply the `noJWT` parameter in the JSON request body on the link:../apis/login#authenticate-a-user[Login API].

== JWT Payload

Passport provides a few custom claims in addition to some registered claims as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1[RFC 7519 Section 4.1].
The following claims will be found in a JWT issued by Passport.

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Claims
|===
|[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]#
|The unique Id of the Application for which the User has been authenticated. A JWT can only represent authorization to a single Application.

This claim is only present if the User has a registration to the Application.

To obtain a JWT for another Application you must either authenticate again with a different `applicationId` using the link:../apis/login#authenticate-a-user[Authentication]
API or utilize the link:../apis/jwt#issue-a-jwt[Issue a JWT] API to exchange a valid JWT for another.

|[field]#aud# [type]#[String]# [since]#Available Since 1.19.0#
|The audience the JWT is intended for. This registered claim is defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3[RFC 7519 Section 4.1.3]

This claim is only present when when authenticating via an OAuth grant and the claim will be equal to the `client_id`.

|[field]#authenticationType# [type]#[String]# [since]#Available Since 1.14.0#
|The method used to authenticate the User which resulted in this JWT being generated. The possible values are:

* `APPLICATION_TOKEN` - The User was authenticated using an link:application-authentication-tokens[Application Authentication Token].
* `FEDERATED` - The User was authenticated using a JWT from a federated Identity Provider.
* `JWT_SSO` - A valid JWT authorized to one Application was exchanged for another JWT authorized to a different Application.
* `PASSWORD` - The User was authenticated using a loginId and password combination.
* `REFRESH_TOKEN` - The User requested a new JWT using a Refresh Token.

|[field]#email# [type]#[String]# [since]#Available Since 1.16.0#
|The email address of the User whose claims are represented by this JWT.

|[field]#email_verified# [type]#[Boolean]# [since]#Available Since 1.19.0#
|The OpenId Connect claim indicating if the User's email has been verified.

|[field]#exp# [type]#[Long]#
|The expiration instant of the JWT expressed as UNIX time which is the number of seconds since Epoch. This registered claim is defined by
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4[RFC 7519 Section 4.1.4]

|[field]#iat# [type]#[Long]#
|The instant that the JWT was issued expressed as UNIX time which is the number of seconds since Epoch. This registered claim is defined by
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.6[RFC 7519 Section 4.1.6]

|[field]#iss# [type]#[String]#
|The issuer of the JWT. For Passport, this is always the value defined in the global JWT configuration. This registered claim is defined by
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1[RFC 7519 Section 4.1.1]

|[field]#roles# [type]#[Array<String>]#
|The roles assigned to the User in the authenticated Application. This claim is only present if the User has a registration to the Application.

|[field]#sub# [type]#[UUID]#
|The subject of the access token. This value is equal to the User's unique Id in Passport. This registered claim is defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2[RFC 7519 Section 4.1.2]

== Refresh Tokens

Refresh tokens are a method of allowing a User to stay logged into an Application for a long period of time without requiring them to type in
their password. This method is often used by Applications that don't store sensitive data such as games and social networks. Passport provides refresh tokens in the response from the link:../apis/login[Login API] provided that you supply these elements:

* `loginId` - the User's login Id
* `password` - the User's password or Authentication Token
* `applicationId` - the identifier for the Application the user is logging into
* `device` - a unique identifier for the device the user is logging in with

If all of these attributes are supplied to the link:../apis/login[Login API] then Passport will produce a refresh token. The refresh token
will be returned in the JSON in the response body as well as in a  in a cookie header. The refresh token will be in a parameter called `refreshToken`
in the JSON response and the HTTP Only persistent cookie will be named `refresh_token`.

Here is an example of this `Set-Cookie` response header for a refresh token.

----
Set-Cookie: refresh_token=eu1SsrjsiDf3h3LryUjxHIKTS0yyrbiPcsKF3HDp; Max-Age=2592000; Expires=Fri, 29-Sep-2017 15:20:24 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly

Here is an example of the JSON response body that contains the refresh token:

[source,json]
.Example JSON with Refresh Token

include::docs/passport/src/json/login/login-response-short-refresh-token.json[]
----

[WARNING]
====
*Note*: Refresh Tokens are considered sensitive information. The token must be secured on the User's device. If a Refresh Token is compromised,
the token bearer may perform authenticated requests on behalf of the User.
====

Once you have a refresh token on the device, you can call the link:../apis/jwt#refresh-a-jwt[Refresh a JWT] API to get a new JWT from Passport using the refresh token.
Using this pattern allows you to perform authenticated actions using the JWT without prompting the User to authenticate as long as the refresh token is active.
