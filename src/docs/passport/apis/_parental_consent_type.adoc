The COPPA and EU consent type that was given to the User (assuming the User is a child under 13) by their parent. This implies verifiable parental consent was given or revoked. The possible values are:

* `EMAIL` - email was used to obtain verifiable parental consent (not used by COPPA any longer)
* `EMAIL_PLUS` - email plus was used to obtain verifiable parental consent
* `FULL` - a method that provides full consent was used
* `INTERNAL_USER` - a method that provides full consent was used and the parent selected to prevent disclosure of the child's information
* `REVOKED` - the consent was revoked by the parent

When this parameter is not defined no permission has been granted.
