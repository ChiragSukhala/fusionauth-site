== Update a User

This API is used to update an existing User. You must specify the Id of the User you are updating on the URI. You must specify all of the properties of the User when calling this API. This API doesn't merge the existing User and your new data. It replaces the existing User with your new data.

If you specify a new password for the User, it will be encrypted and stored. However, if you do not provide a new password, the User's old password will be preserved. This is the only field that is merged during an update.

=== Request

== Start Forgot Password Workflow

This API is used to start the forgot password workflow for a single User.

For example, on your login form you may have a button for _Forgot your password_. This would be the API you would call to initiate the request for the user. If the email configuration is complete, the user
 will be sent the forgot password email containing a link containing the `changePasswordId`. The provided link should take the user to a form that allows them to change their password. This form should contain a hidden
  field for the `changePasswordId` generated by this API.

By default the `changePasswordId` is valid to be used with the link:#change-a-user-s-password[Change Password] API for 10 minutes. If a `404` is returned when using this Id to change the password, the workflow
will need to be started again to generate a new identifier. This duration can be modified using the System Configuration API or in the Passport UI.

You may optionally authenticate this request with an API key to allow for some additional request parameters and the generated `changePasswordId` will be returned in the JSON body.
 This may be helpful if you wish to use your own email system or you have an alternative method to call the link:#change-a-user-s-password[Change Password] API.

=== Request

== Change a User's Password

This API is used to change the User's password.

This API may be used as the second part of the Forgot Password workflow. For example, after the User is sent an email that contains a link to
 a web form that allows them to update their password you will call this API with the `changePasswordId` and their updated password. If the
  `changePasswordId` is valid then the User's password will be updated.

This API may also be used separately from the Forgot Password workflow by omitting the `changePasswordId` and using the `loginId` instead.

By default the `changePasswordId` is valid for 10 minutes after it was generated. If a `404` is returned when using the change password Id,
the workflow will need to be started again to generate a new identifier. This duration can be modified using the System Configuration API or in the Passport UI.

== Flush the Search Engine

This API is used to issue a flush request to the Passport Search Engine. This will cause any cached data to be written to disk. In practice it is unlikely
 you'll find a need for this API in production unless you are performing search requests immediately following an operation that modifies the index and
  expecting to see the results immediately.
