== Overview

This page contains the APIs that are used to manage the Audit Log. Here are the APIs:

* <<Add an Entry to the Audit Log>>
* <<Retrieve an Audit Log>>
* <<Search the Audit Log>>


== Add an Entry to the Audit Log

This API allows you to insert an Audit Log. Generally, Audit Logs are created automatically whenever an admin does something from the Passport Backend interface. However, you can use this API to insert Audit Logs directly if you need.
