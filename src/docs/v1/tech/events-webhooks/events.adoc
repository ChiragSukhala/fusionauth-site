== Events

These are the events that FusionAuth generates that can be optionally consumed by your registered Webhook.

* <<User Actions>> - when a moderator takes an action on a user
* <<User Bulk Create>> - when multiple users are created as the result of the Import API
* <<User Create>> - when a user is created
* <<User Update>> - when a user is updated
* <<User Deactivate>> - when a user is deactivated
* <<User Reactivate>> - when a user is reactivated
* <<User Delete>> - when a user is deleted
* <<User Email Verified>> - when a user verifies their email address
* <<User Login Success>> - when a user successfully completes login
* <<User Login Failure>> - when a user fails to complete login
* <<User Registration Create>> - when a new user registration is created
* <<User Registration Update>> - when a user registration is update
* <<User Registration Delete>> - when a user registration is deleted
* <<User Registration Verified>> - when a user completes registration verification
* <<JWT Public Key Update>> - when a JWT RSA Public / Private keypair used for signing may have been updated.
* <<JWT Refresh Token Revoke>> - when a refresh token (or multiple tokens) are revoked


== User Actions

This event is generated when a User Action is taken on a user and when temporal actions transition between phases.

A temporal action is one that has a start time and and a duration, when a phase transition occurs an event will be sent to the webhook. See the [field]#event.phase# in the message body.

|This parameter specifies the unique identifier of the user the action is being performed on.

|[field]#event.actionerUserId# [type]#[UUID]#
|This parameter specifies the Id of the User that performed the action that resulted in the notification being sent. If the action was initiated by FusionAuth this value will not be provided.

|[field]#event.applicationIds# [type]#[Array<UUID>]#

|[field]#event.createInstant# [type]#[Long]#
|The link:../reference/data-types#instant[instant] that the event was generated.

|[field]#event.email# [type]#[Object]#
|When the action is configured to send the email in the event body, FusionAuth will render the email and provide the result in the event body. This can be used to send an email through a third party provider. See Example POST body below for fields.

|[field]#event.emailedUser# [type]#[Boolean]#
|This parameter will indicate if FusionAuth has already sent an email to the user as a result of this event. When `true` an email was sent to the user, and if `false` an email was not sent to the user.

|[field]#event.expiry# [type]#[Long]#
|The link:../reference/data-types#instant[instant] that the action will expire, if the action expires.

|[field]#event.id# [type]#[UUID]#
|The event unique Id. You may receive an event more than once based upon your transaction settings. This Id may be used to identify a duplicate event.

|[field]#event.localizedAction# [type]#[String]#
|This parameter specifies the localized version of the [field]#action# field, based on the user's preferred languages.

|[field]#event.localizedDuration# [type]#[String]#

|[field]#event.phase# [type]#[Boolean]#
|If the Action is temporal, this parameter will be provided to indicate the current phase of the action. The following are the possible Action states:

* `start` - The event has started.
* `modify` - The event has been modified.
* `cancel` - The event has been canceled, the `end` phase will not be reached.
* `end` - The event has ended.

When the action is started by an admin, the phase will be "start". If an admin changes the duration of the action, the phase will be "modify". If an admin cancels an action it will be "cancel" or the action expires, the phase will be "end". If the action is key-based, the phase will be "start".

|[field]#event.reason# [type]#[String]#
|The reason the admin selected. Reasons may be configured in the FusionAuth UI, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#User Actions# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#Reasons#. This value will be omitted when no reasons are selected (or configured).

|[field]#event.reasonCode# [type]#[String]#
|The reason code the admin selected. Reasons may be configured in the FusionAuth UI, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#User Actions# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#Reasons#.

== JWT Refresh Token Revoke

This event is generated when a refresh token is revoked. The JSON includes either the User Id or the Application Id depending on what was revoked. It will also include the time to live duration (in seconds) for each Application. This value is used to determine if JWTs are valid or not based on their expiration instants.

The following scenarios will cause this event to be generated:

* A single Refresh Token is revoked
* All Refresh Tokens owned by a single User are revoked
* All Refresh Tokens for an Application are revoked

[source,shell]

|A map of Application Id to the configured time to live (TTL) for the access token (JWT). This can be used to identify the maximum amount of time after this event occurred where an un-expired access token may be held by a user.

If you take the [field]#createInstant# of this event and add the number of seconds for a specific application TTL you come up with an instant in time where you should consider all access tokens issued before this time invalid. This is because the access token will have been issued on or before the instant the refresh token was revoked.

This map will contain a single entry for the application represented by the [field]#applicationId# field.
