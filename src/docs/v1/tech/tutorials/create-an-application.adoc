== Create an Application

Before you start your integration with FusionAuth you need to setup at least one Application. Applications are the way that FusionAuth manages
registrations of a user. If you haven't read the link:../getting-started/[Overview] section yet, it describes the relationship
between **Users** and **Applications**. An Application in FusionAuth represents an authenticated resource.

Click on the [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#Applications# menu to add an application. You can optionally define all of the roles for you Application
on this form as well, or do so later.
