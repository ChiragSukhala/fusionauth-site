== Authorize

This is an implementation of the Authorization endpoint as defined by the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1[IETF RFC 6749 Section 3.1].

=== Authorization Code Grant Request

To begin the Authorization Code Grant you will redirect to the Authorization endpoint from your application.

[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/oauth2/authorize``?client_id=\{client_id\}&redirect_uri=\{redirect_uri\}&response_type=code``#
--

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Request Parameters
|===
|[field]#client_id# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The unique client identifier. The client Id is the Id of the FusionAuth Application in which you you are attempting to authenticate.

|[field]#code_challenge# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available Since 1.8.0#
|The `code_challenge` parameter as described in the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636[Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients (PKCE)] specification. When this parameter is provided during the Authorization request, a corresponding [field]#code_verifier# parameter is required on the subsequent `POST` to the `/oauth2/token` endpoint.

|[field]#code_challenge_method# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available Since 1.8.0#
|The `code_challenge_method` parameter as described in the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636[Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients (PKCE)] specification. This parameter is required when [field]#code_challenge# is set, the value must be set to `S256`.

|[field]#metaData.device.description# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|A human readable description of the device used during login. This meta data is used to describe the refresh token that may be generated for this login request.

|[field]#nonce# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available Since 1.5.0#
|The `nonce` parameter as described in the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect core] specification. When this parameter is provided during the Authorization request, the value will be returned in the `id_token`.

|[field]#redirect_uri# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The URI to redirect to upon a successful request. This URI must have been configured previously in the FusionAuth Application OAuth
configuration. See Applications in the FusionAuth User Guide for additional information on configuring the redirect URI.

|[field]#response_type# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The requested response type. For the Authorization Code Grant, this value must be set to `code`.

|[field]#scope# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|If you are using OpenID Connect, the request must contain this parameter and at minimum it must contain `openid`. This parameter may contain multiple scopes space separated. For example, the value of `openid offline_access` provides two scopes on the request.

Available scopes:

* `openid` - This scope is used to request an `id_token` be returned in the response
* `offline_access` - This scope scope is used to request a `refresh_token` be returned in the response

|[field]#state# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The optional state parameter, this is generally used as a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token. Any value provided in this field will be returned on a successful redirect. See https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect core] specification for additional information on how this parameter may be utilized.

|The requested user is already logged in, the request will redirect to the location specified in the `redirect_uri` on the request.

|400
|The request was invalid and/or malformed. The response will contain a JSON message with the specific errors. The error response JSON
is covered in the OAuthError section of the API documentation.

|500
