The [General Data Protection Regulation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:L:2016:119:FULL "Jump to full GDPR text") (GDPR) defines a set of "user's digital rights" and became enforceable on May 25, 2018. Download this developer's guide to understand how it will affect a developer's role and responsibilities in application development.

## What is the GDPR?

In general, the GDPR replaces the [1995 Data Protection Directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML "Jump to full Data Protection Directive") and unifies the complex web of data protection regulations used throughout the EU. It will have a dramatic impact on how companies can collect, store and utilize information they obtain about their audience. For developers, the GDPR provides a framework of requirements that will impact the business processes and architectural roadmaps for any application.

## Does the GDPR Apply in the US?

The requirements of the GDPR apply to all companies who have interactions with people connected to the EU in some capacity, whether physically or virtually. With a population of over 500 million, [third largest after China and India](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/figures/living_en "Jump to EU stats"), and some of the [world's most well-traveled citizens](https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/these-countries-have-the-most-well-traveled-citizens "Jump to CN Traveler post"), there's always a good chance that you'll be interacting with someone who's covered. The bottom line is If you collect data that is connected to a person, you should plan on it impacting you.

## Read this Developer's Guide to the GDPR

The GDPR is a long and complex document and there are [many resources](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1712&amp;bih=943&amp;ei=hI6hWvDIBMLCzgK31qnQCw&amp;q=gdpr "Search Google for GDPR resources") that examine the details of each section. This developer's guide is an outline explaining how developers will be impacted by the regulations, and how they should make GDPR considerations part of their workflow. We cover:
- Who does it impact?
- What data are we talking about?
- When does it apply?
- Where do the regulations apply?
- What to ask third-party providers?

We also explain how FusionAuth was developed from the beginning with even stricter regulations in mind, so we didn't have to go far to comply with the GDPR. We fully agree with these regulations and feel they provide effective guidelines that any application or system should follow with their users' personal data.
