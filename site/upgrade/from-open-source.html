<h1>Upgrade from Homegrown</h1>

<p>Spend your time and resources on your app, not building secure authentication and identity.
It’s easy to switch. </p>

<h2>Auth is complex and doesn’t earn revenue</h2>
<p>Auth and identity are complex and can take experienced developers months to build, test, and then maintain, especially if they aren’t full-time security experts. This opens you to risk, and takes you away from building features that earn you money.</p>

<p>FusionAuth installs in minutes on any platform, and integrates with any codebase or framework. You get all the features, security and performance you need for all your apps without lifting a finger. Here are a few reasons FusionAuth is better than rolling your own.</p>
