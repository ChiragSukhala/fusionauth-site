<h2>Easy to deploy and easy to integrate</h2>
<p>Existing open-source and legacy identity solutions require multiple module downloads, complex configuration syntax, and extensive custom code to get up and running. They also limit access to premium features and knowledgeable support engineers unless you purchase commercial licenses.</p>

<p>FusionAuth is built on modern technology so it’s simple to deploy and even simpler to get configured and integrated. Just run our one-line Fast Path installer and we walk you through the rest. You get full access to all our APIs in seconds–no restrictions, no premium-level features. From day one you get an enterprise-ready identity management solution with a strong community of developers, too. </p>
