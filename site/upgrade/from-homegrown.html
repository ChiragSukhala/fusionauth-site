            <p class="lh-2">Existing open-source and legacy identity solutions require multiple module downloads, complex configuration
              syntax, and extensive custom code to get up and running. They also limit access to premium features and knowledgeable support
              engineers unless you purchase commercial licenses.</p>

            <p class="lh-2">FusionAuth is built on modern technology so it’s simple to deploy and even simpler to get configured and
              integrated. Just run our one-line Fast Path installer and we walk you through the rest. You get full access to all our APIs in
              seconds–no restrictions, no premium-level features. From day one you get an enterprise-ready identity management solution with
              a strong community of developers, too. </p>

<h1>Upgrade from Homegrown</h1>

<p>Spend your time and resources on your app, not building secure authentication and identity.
It’s easy to switch. </p>

<h2>Auth is complex and doesn’t earn revenue</h2>
<p>Auth and identity are complex and can take experienced developers months to build, test, and then maintain, especially if they aren’t full-time security experts. This opens you to risk, and takes you away from building features that earn you money.</p>

<p>FusionAuth installs in minutes on any platform, and integrates with any codebase or framework. You get all the features, security and performance you need for all your apps without lifting a finger. Here are a few reasons FusionAuth is better than rolling your own.</p>

<h3>FusionAuth gives you:</h3>

<h4>Everything you need</h4>
<p>FusionAuth is a complete identity and access management solution that puts you in control of your apps, data, and users. Check out the features you get out-of-the-box.</p>

<h4>Ability to deploy anywhere</h4>
<p>FusionAuth is a universal solution that works on any platform and integrates with any codebase. Learn more here.</p>

<h4>Constant testing and updates</h4>
<p>Our identity and security experts are constantly improving FusionAuth with new features and protecting against the newest threats.</p>

<h4>Scalability for millions of users</h4>
<p>We’ve tested FusionAuth to over 150,000,000 users. Grow as big as you like–we got ya covered.</p>

<h4>Reporting and analytics</h4>
<p>At-a-glance dashboards show your users’ daily and monthly activity for essential business insights. </p>

<h4>Freedom to earn revenue</h4>
<p>Auth doesn’t earn revenue. Put your developer resources into building cool features that delight your customers and earn you money.</p>
