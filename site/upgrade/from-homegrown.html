        <h2>Auth Is Complex and Doesn't Earn Revenue</h2>
        <p>
          Auth and identity are complex and can take experienced developers months to build, test, and then maintain, especially if they aren't full-time security experts. This opens you to risk, and takes you away from building features that earn you money.
        </p>
        <p>
          FusionAuth installs in minutes on any platform, and integrates with any codebase or framework. You get all the features, security and performance you need for all your apps without lifting a finger. Here are a few reasons FusionAuth is better than rolling your own.
