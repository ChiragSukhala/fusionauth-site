## Legally Required Password Constraints
According to [Verizon’s Data Breach Investigations Report](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/ "Jump to Verizon's site"), the overwhelming majority of hacking-related breaches took advantage of stolen and/or weak passwords. To address this risk, many organizations are required by law to enforce strict password constraints. Their guidelines are based on extensive study of the mathematical principles of password entropy and are proven to construct stronger passwords. (Read more about entropy and [password hashing strategies here.](/blog/2019/02/21/save-a-cpu-ditch-bcrypt-use-sha2-instead)) Take advantage of these established guidelines in your internal conversations with your engineering and security teams to improve security and ensure compliance with industry regulations.
