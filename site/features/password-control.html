        <h2>Any Password</h2>
        <p>
          FusionAuth allows users to select any password they want. Spaces, punctuation, uppercase, lowercase, Unicode, Emoji, and even line art all work. They can even use a password with 237 characters if they want.

        <h2>Secure Hashing</h2>
        <p>
          FusionAuth supports industry standard hashing algorithms and doesn't force you to use only one. You can also upgrade a user's security during login with a stronger hash. FusionAuth even has a plugin system that allows you to import users with any hashing system without requiring them to reset their password.
