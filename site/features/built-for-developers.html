        <h2>APIs Galore</h2>
        <p>
          Nearly every feature of FusionAuth is accessible via our APIs. That's because we built the APIs first and our UI on top of them. This means that you can perform any action in FusionAuth from your application whenever you need.

        <h2>Webhooks and Kafka</h2>
        <p>
          FusionAuth can fire events to Webhooks in your backend. It can also publish events to Kafka topics. FusionAuth currently fires events including things like user creation, user login and many others. We're also adding new events all the time.

        <h2>User Events</h2>
        <p>
          FusionAuth allows you to create customizable user events (we call them user actions) that you can fire on users. These events can be time-based or singular events and are great for handling rewards, discipline (blocking, muting or banning users) or workflow integrations with your backend.

        <h2>Lambdas</h2>
        <p>
          Gone are the days of horrible web UIs to try and map user data into JWT or SAML claims. FusionAuth lets you write JavaScript snippets that make mapping claims and handling federation responses simple.

        <p>
          FusionAuth API keys are simple to create and provide the ability to lock API keys to specific APIs. Revoking keys is also a snap.
