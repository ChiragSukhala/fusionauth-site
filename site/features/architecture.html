        <h2>Self-hosting or FusionAuth Cloud</h2>
        <p>
          Every instance of FusionAuth is an isolated deployment with its own servers and database. This ensures that your data is completely isolated from other customers and applications. This means you can run FusionAuth on any server, anywhere in the world. Or let us host it for you.

        <h2>Choose Your Database</h2>
        <p>
          FusionAuth supports MySQL or PostgreSQL databases. This means you pick the database server that best fits your needs. Most cloud database provides are also supported including Amazon's RDS and Google's Cloud SQL.

        <h2>Vanilla Elasticsearch</h2>
        <p>
          FusionAuth uses Elasticsearch to provide advanced user search capabilities. Any Elasticsearch 6.x server will work. This means you can use cloud provided Elasticsearch options or roll your own Elasticsearch cluster.

        <h2>Multi-tenant Capable</h2>
        <p>
          FusionAuth allows you to create tenants that logically separate Applications, Users, Themes, Emails and more. This is great for white-labelling, multiple environments (dev, stage, prod) on a single deployment, and much more. Read this <a href="#" class="orange-text">blog post</a> to learn more about FusionAuth's multi-tenant support.

        <h2>Support for Multiple Applications</h2>
        <p>
          You can connect any number of applications to FusionAuth. You can also use the FusionAuth OpenID Connect or SAML v2 front-end to provide single sign-on for all your apps. Roles are also separated by application to provide complete control over authorization for your users.
