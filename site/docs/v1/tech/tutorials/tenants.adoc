== Make an API call for a specific tenant

When more than one tenant exists, some APIs will require a tenant Id to ensure the request is not ambiguous.

There are two supported methods to provide the tenant Id to FusionAuth during the API request. The first is by using
an HTTP header, and the other is using an API key that has been assigned to a specific tenant.

=== Using an HTTP Header

.HTTP Header example

The following example demonstrates the HTTP Tenant header with an Id of `24b325e1-c1b8-4cc6-a2d3-ea316cec9e2e`.

----
X-FusionAuth-TenantId: 24b325e1-c1b8-4cc6-a2d3-ea316cec9e2e

=== Using an API key

You may optionally create an API key that is scoped to a particular tenant. To create an API key  navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#API Keys#.

In the following example screenshot the tenant `Pied Piper` has been selected, this API key can be used to make API requests to FusionAuth instead of the HTTP header. Only Users, Groups and Applications belonging to the selected tenant will be visible to this API.

=== Tenant Required Error

If you make an API request when the Tenant Id is required, you will receive a `400` response code with the following response body.

[source,json]
.Tenant Required Error
----
{
  "generalErrors" : [ {
    "code" : "[TenantIdRequired]",
    "message" : "A Tenant Id is required to complete this request. To complete this request, you may assign a Tenant to your API key, or add the X-FusionAuth-TenantId HTTP request header with the Tenant Id."
  } ]
}
