== Overview

Integrations allow you to extend the feature set of FusionAuth by utilizing third party APIs. The following integrations are
currently available.

Find the FusionAuth Integrations in the UI by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Integrations# or use the link:../apis/integrations[Integrations] APIs. Each available integration will show up in gray scale with the *[green-text]#Enable#* green text in the bottom right. To enable and configure and integration click on the tile and select `Enable`. Once enabled, the tile will show the color version of the tile and the text in the bottom right will read *[blue-text]#Configure#* in blue text.
