== Overview

https://www.inversoft.com/products/profanity-filter[CleanSpeak] is an industry leading profanity and moderation platform. To
utilize the CleanSpeak integration you'll need the URL of your CleanSpeak API and a valid API key.

Enabling the CleanSpeak integration provides username filtering for new Users and username modifications to existing Users. This
integration allows you to prevent profanity from showing up in your application by way of username.

In the following example, the username `shithead` is not allowed to be entered when the CleanSpeak integration has been enabled.
