See the link:../apis/two-factor#enable-two-factor[Enable Two Factor] and link:../apis/two-factor#disable-two-factor[Disable Two Factor] APIs as an alternative to performing this action using the User API.

[field]#user.twoFactorSecret# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The Base64 encoded secret used to generate Two Factor verification codes.
+
You may optionally use value provided in the `secret` field returned by the link:../apis/two-factor#generate-a-secret[Two Factor Secret] API instead of generating this value yourself.
+
Unless you are using `TextMessage` as your delivery type, ensure you are able to share the secret with the User before enabling Two Factor authentication. Beginning in version 1.17.0, if you do create a User with `TextMessage` set as the `twoFactorDelivery` type and you omit this value, the secret will be generated for you. The secret can be generated because it is not necessary to share the secret with the User for this delivery method.
+
When using `None` as the `twoFactorDelivery` this value will be required.

[field]#user.username# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The username of the User.
