==== Request Headers

[.api]
[field]#X-FusionAuth-TenantId# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The unique Id of the tenant used to scope this API request.
+
When only a single tenant is configured the tenant Id can be assumed and this additional header is optional. Once more than one tenant has been configured in FusionAuth the tenant Id is required for this request because the input parameters by themselves do not indicate which tenant the request is intended.
+
The tenant Id may be provided through this header or by using a tenant locked API key to achieve the same result.

See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#making-an-api-request-using-a-tenant-id[Making an API request using a Tenant Id] for additional information.
