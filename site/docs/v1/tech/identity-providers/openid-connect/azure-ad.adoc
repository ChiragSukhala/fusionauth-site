== Configure OpenID Connect with Azure Active Directory

[NOTE]
====
FusionAuth's OpenID Connect flow currently only supports link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview[Azure Active Directory v1.0].

link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview[Azure Active Directory v2.0] returns inconsistent claims from the UserInfo endpoint depending on the type of Microsoft account the end-user has.  See link:https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/28317[this open issue] for reference.

The email address is required to be returned on the Userinfo endpoint, without this identity claim FusionAuth cannot complete login. Currently the https://graph.microsoft.com/oidc/userinfo endpoint does not necessarily return the email address of the user even when requesting the `openid` and `email` scopes. These scopes do provide the `email` claim in the returned `access_token` and `id_token` but are omitted from the Userinfo response.
====

Once you have completed this configuration you may enable an OpenID Connect "Login with Azure AD" button for one or more FusionAuth Applications.  See link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app[Azure - Register An App Quickstart Guide] as an additional reference.

=== Register a New Azure Active Directory Application

You will first need to login to the link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/[Azure Portal].

Once logged in, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations -> New Registration# to create a new Azure Active Directory Application.

Here we have configured our application `Redirect URI`.  If FusionAuth is running at `https://local.fusionauth.io`, this value should be `https://local.fusionauth.io/oauth2/callback`.

Once the application has been created, note the `Application (client) ID` and the `Directory (tenant) ID`.  These will be used respectively as the [field]#Client Id# value and to construct the [field]#Issuer# value in your FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Providers configuration.

=== Create a New Azure Active Directory Application Secret

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations -> {Your Application} -> Certificates & secrets -> New client secret# to create a new Azure Active Directory Application Client Secret.

Note the `VALUE` of the created client secret.  This will be used as the [field]#Client secret# value in your FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Providers configuration.

=== Configure a New FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Provider

To create an Azure AD Identity Provider return to FusionAuth and navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and click `Add provider` and select `OpenID Connect` from the dialog.

This will take you to the `Add OpenID Connect` panel, and you'll fill out the required fields.

You will need to set [field]#Client authentication method# to `HTTP Basic authentication (client_secret_basic)`.

[field]#Client Id# and [field]#Client secret# values reference the previously noted Azure AD Application's `Application (client) ID`, client secret `VALUE`. The [field]#Redirect URL# is read only and generated for you based upon the URL of FusionAuth, this value should match the one you configured in your Azure application.

Azure AD has implemented a well-known configuration endpoint, FusionAuth will be able to discover the necessary endpoints when you provide the URL `\https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}` to the provider in the `Issuer` field, where `{tenantId}` is the `Directory (tenant) ID` previously noted while creating our Azure AD Application.

You will need to specify `openid` as a [field]#Scope# for your application.

In the following screenshot you will see that we have enabled this login provider for the `Hooli` application and enabled `Create registration`.

That's it, now the `Login with Azure AD` button will show up on the login page of our `Hooli` application.
