== Configure OpenID Connect with GitHub

[NOTE]
====
GitHub user's must have a public email address configured for their account in order for this login flow to succeed.
====

Once you have completed this configuration you may enable an OpenID Connect "Login with GitHub" button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. See link:https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/[GitHub - Creating an OAuth App] for an additional reference.

=== Register a GitHub OAuth2 Application

You will first need to login to link:https://github.com/[GitHub].

Once logged in, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#Developer settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#OAuth Apps# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#Register a new application# to create a new GitHub OAuth Application.

Here we have configured our application `Authorization callback URL`.  If FusionAuth is running at `https://local.fusionauth.io`, this value should be `https://local.fusionauth.io/oauth2/callback`.

Once the application has been created, note the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret`.  These will be used respectively as the [field]#Client Id# value and the [field]#Client secret# value in your FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Providers configuration.

=== Configure a New FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Provider

To create a GitHub Identity Provider return to FusionAuth and navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#Identity Providers# and click `Add provider` and select `OpenID Connect` from the dialog.

This will take you to the `Add OpenID Connect` panel, and you'll fill out the required fields.  [field]#Client Id# and [field]#Client secret# values reference the previously noted GitHub OAuth Application's `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. The [field]#Redirect URL# is read only and generated for you based upon the URL of FusionAuth, this value should match the one you configured in your GitHub application.

GitHub has not implemented a well-known configuration endpoint, so you will need to disable the [field]#Discover endpoints# field and specify the endpoints manually.  The values for these fields are:

* `Authorization endpoint` - `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`
* `Token endpoint` - `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`
* `Userinfo endpoint` - `https://api.github.com/user`

You will need to specify `user:email` as a [field]#Scope# for your application.

In the following screenshot you will see that we have enabled this login provider for the `Aviato` application and enabled [field]#Create registration#.

GitHub does not implement OpenID Connect to spec. In order to pull in some additional data for populating the user profile (GitHub shortname, Image URL, etc.) you can enable a [field]#Reconcile lambda#.  See link:../../lambdas/openid-connect-response-reconcile[this example lambda] which is based on the GitHub use case.  This is optional.

That's it, now the `Login with GitHub` button will show up on the login page of our `Aviato` application.
