== Overview

Adding a Login with Facebook button to FusionAuth is simple, and this guide will walk you through the steps necessary to collect the credentials from Facebook in order to enable this Social login.

* <<Create a Facebook Account>>
* <<Add a Facebook Application>>
* <<Create a Facebook Identity Provider>>

Once you have completed this configuration you will be able to enable the Facebook login button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. Below is an example login page with the Facebook Identity Provider enabled.

== Create a Facebook Account

If you do not yet have a Facebook account, go ahead and do that first. If you need help with this step, ask your kids.

* https://www.facebook.com/

== Add a Facebook Application

In order to enable the Login with Facebook option in FusionAuth we'll need to add a Facebook application. Follow the provided link or navigate to your Facebook developer account to continue.

* https://developers.facebook.com/apps/

=== Create a new App Id

Click on the `Add a new App` button to create a new Facebook application. The application `Display Name` will be shown to users when they log into FusionAuth using Facebook. Complete this form and click the `Create App ID` button.

=== Configure Facebook Login

In order to enable Facebook login for this newly created Application, add the `Facebook Login` product to this application. The `Add a Product` is likely the first page you'll see after creating the Application, but if not find the `Products +` or `Add Product` section and find the `Facebook Login` tile and click `Set Up`.

You'll now have the `Facebook Login` product listed under the `Products` section of your application. Click on the `Settings` sub-menu of the `Facebook Login` section in the left navigation. Review this page to ensure it meets your security requirements, however the default Client OAuth Settings should be sufficient.

=== Collect App ID and App Secret

To complete the configuration you will need to collect the `App ID` and the `App Secret` to use in the FusionAuth configuration. To find these values, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Basic# in the left navigation.

You can either record these values now, or keep this page open so you can copy and paste these values during the next step in FusionAuth.

Add the top level domain of your application in the `App Domains` field, in this example I have added `piedpiper.com` because my application login will originate from `\https://login.piedpiper.com`.

Note that status of this application shows `OFF`, to make this application public you will need to change the status which will require a few other settings that Facebook will prompt you to complete. However you may use this application to login while in this state.

== Create a Facebook Identity Provider

The last step will be to create a Facebook Identity Provider in FusionAuth. To create an Identity Provider navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and click `Add provider` and select `Facebook` from the dialog.

This will take you to the `Add Facebook` panel, and you'll fill out the `App Id` and `App Secret` required fields using the values from the Facebook console. The button text is also required but it will be defaulted to `Login with Facebook`, you may optionally modify this default value.

To enable this identity provider for an application, find your application name in the `Applications` configuration section at the bottom of this panel. You will always see the `FusionAuth` application, this application represents the FusionAuth user interface. If you wish to be able to log into FusionAuth with this provider you may enable this application.

In the following screenshot you will see that we have enabled this login provider for the `Pied Piper` application and enabled `Create registration`. Enabling create registration means that a user does not need to be manually registered for the application prior to using this login provider.

For example, when a new user attempts to log into `Pied Piper` using Facebook, if their user does not exist in FusionAuth it will be created dynamically, and if the `Create registration` toggle has been enabled, the user will also be registered for `Pied Piper` and assigned any default roles assigned by the application.

If you do not wish to automatically provision a user for this Application when logging in with Facebook, leave `Create registration` off and you will need to manually register a user for this application before they may complete login with Facebook.

That's it, now the `Login with Facebook` button will show up on the login page for Pied Piper.
