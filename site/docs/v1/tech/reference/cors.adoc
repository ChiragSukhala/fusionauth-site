description: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration

== Overview

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[Cross-Origin Resources Sharing] (CORS) provide a mechanism to control permission
to resources on a server on a different domain or origin than the originating request. Practically this means that in order to make HTTP requests in JavaScript to FusionAuth when the request
is coming from a different domain CORS needs to be configured to allow the request.

Most of the time this works as designed you do not need to think much about CORS configuration. In some cases you may find the configuration is restricting the way you want to use FusionAuth. If this happens FusionAuth allows you to modify or disable the CORS filter.

== Configuration

[NOTE.since]
====
Available Since Version 1.8.0.
====

To modify the default CORS configuration navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> System -> CORS#. Please utilize caution when modifying this configuration, with great power comes great responsibility.

=== CORS Excluded URI Paths
We have excluded some paths from FusionAuth CORS filtering in order to force same-origin browser requests on these paths. The following are the URL patterns excluded from our CORS filter.

* `/account*`
* `/admin*`
* `/support*`
* `/ajax*`

== Default Configuration

The following reference has been provided in case you want to return the CORS filter configuration to the original values provided by FusionAuth.
