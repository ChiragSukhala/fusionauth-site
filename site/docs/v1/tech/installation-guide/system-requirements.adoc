have any questions about platform support, please contact us. Please read through this documentation and ensure you have met all of
the requirements before continuing with the installation of FusionAuth.

== Database

* MySQL 5.7.9 or newer.
** IBM Compose for MySQL or other MysQL platforms that utilize MySQL Group Replication are not supported.

== Elasticsearch

* Elasticsearch is a core required for FusionAuth
* You can use the link:packages#fusionauth-search[`fusionauth-search`] package or any other Elasticsearch service including a cloud hosted service or just downloading it and installing it yourself from https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[elastic.co].
