== Overview

Passport supports the following two grant types as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[RFC 6749].

* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1[Authorization Code Grant]
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.3[Resource Owner Password Credentials]


The following is an example of a typical way to use the Passport OAuth Provider with the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1[Authorization Code Grant].

1. Add an Application and complete the OAuth configuration
2. Point your application to the `/oauth2/authorize` endpoint
3. Retrieve the authorization code on the redirect URI provided on the authorize request
4. Make a `POST` request to `/oauth2/token` in order to exchange the authorization code for an access token and a user id
5. Retrieve the user and log them into your application
6. Log out

== Integrate the Passport OAuth Provider in your application

=== Add a Passport Application

Navigate to the Application configuration from the settings menu, `Settings -> Applications`. If you have already created a Passport
application for the purpose your application, you do not need to create another, however you will still need to complete the OAuth configuration.
If an application has not yet been created, click 'Add' and name your application accordingly and fill out the OAuth configuration.

.OAuth Form Fields
|===
|Client Id
|The unique client identifier as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.2[RFC 6749 Section 2.2]. This value is read only,
it is equal to unique Id of the Application.

|Client secret
|The client secret as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3-1[RFC 6749 Section 2.3-1]. This value is read only, it is
generated by Passport. It is not currently used by any of the supported OAuth grants.

|Authorized redirect URLs
|One or more authorized URLs that the OAuth grant workflow may redirect to upon completion.

|Authorized request origin URLs
|One or more authorized origins that can initiate the OAuth grant to the `/oauth2/authorize` or `/oauth2/token` endpoints. Leaving this
value empty will allow all origins.

|Logout URL
|The URL used to perform the `302` redirect as the response from the `/oauth2/logout` API.
|===

=== Point your application to the authorize endpoint

Now that your Passport application has been configured to use the OAuth provider, you may now point the login for your application to the
Passport authorize endpoint which will now handle user authentication.

For the purposes of this example, I will make the assumption that Passport Backend is running locally at `http://localhost:9011`. The authorize
URL will look something like following, review the `/oauth2/authorize`  endpoint documentation for more detail.

http://localhost:9011/oauth2/authorize?client_id=06494b74-a796-4723-af44-1bdb96b48875&redirect_uri=https://www.vandelayindustries.com/login&response_type=code
----

=== Consume the authorization code returned from the authorize request

When the authorize request completes successfully it will respond with a status code of `302` to the location provided by the redirect_uri
parameter. The request will contain a code parameter which can be exchanged for an access token. The access token contains the user Id of the
authenticated user which can then be used to retrieve the entire user object.

The following is an example redirect URI containing the authorization code.

----

=== Exchange the authorization code for an access token

The last step to complete the authentication process and retrieve the users Id is to exchange the returned authorization code for an
access token. The JSON response will contain the user Id of the authenticated user.

}

=== Verify Authorization

If you only need to validate registration and User roles, this can be done by inspecting the JWT payload as returned in the `access_token`
property of the response body.

If you require the entire User object to validate authorization, you may need to retrieve the entire User. The User may be
retrieved in one of several ways. If you have an API key ou can retrieve the User by Id or email, these two values are returned in the JWT
payload. The email address is returned in the `email` identity claim, and the User's Id is returned in the `sub` identity claim. You may
also retrieve the User without an API key by utilizing the JWT as returned in the `access_token` property in the response body.

See the link:../apis/users#retrieve-a-user[Retrieve a User] API for examples.

Now that you have the user, or retrieved the roles from the JWT, you may review their roles and registration to ensure they have adequate
authority for the intended action, and if the user is not yet registered for the requested application, you can either fail their login,
or complete a registration workflow. Once you have determined a user can be logged into your application, you'll need to log them into
your application. For a web based application, this generally will include creating an HTTP session and storing the user in the newly created session.

=== Log Out

To log the user out, a typical workflow would include first logging out of your application, if that is successful, you would then log the
user out of Passport. This is accomplished by making a `[GET]` request to the `/oauth2/logout` endpoint. The logout request will complete
with a `302` redirect to the configured logout URL.
