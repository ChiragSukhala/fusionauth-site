== Setup Wizard

This tutorial guides you through completing the initial Passport configuration necessary prior to making API calls and beginning your integration.

=== Access Passport Backend

The first step is to access Passport Backend in your web browser. If Inversoft is hosting Passport in our private cloud, the URL will be
located on your https://www.inversoft.com/account[Inversoft Account] labeled Web interface. If you have installed Passport on your own system,
you will need to know the IP address or hostname of the system where it has been installed. For example, to access Passport on localhost, you
would use the following URL http://localhost:9011.

Once you have a web browser open to the Passport Backend you will be presented with a setup wizard that will walk you through getting Passport
configured and ready to begin calling the API and managing users. Once the setup wizard is complete you will be logged into Passport using
the created Administrator account.

=== Complete the Setup Wizard

==== License verification
The purpose of this step is to verify that the person that is completing this setup wizard has access to the Inversoft account that was issued
the license. This security step is most relevant when we're provisioning Passport servers on our private cloud.

When accessing Passport using the URL provided from your Inversoft account you will not be required to verify your license Id.

==== Administrator account
This will be the first account to be created in Passport and this user will be assigned the `admin` role the Passport application. Additional
users can be assigned the `admin` role at a later time.

==== Session Timezone
This value will default to a best guess based upon your location. Modify this value if necessary. Each time you log into Passport Backend
a Timezone will be selected that will be used to localize date and times displayed in the user interface.

== Complete Setup

Once the Setup Wizard has logged you into Passport you may begin using Passport. On the dashboard you will see the remaining setup items.
This includes setting up an API key, creating an Application and completing the SMTP Email configuration.

=== Application
Passport can be configured with one to many Applications. A Passport Application represents a secured resource, it should be thoughtfully
named but the name may be modified at a later time.

You may optionally define roles now. These may be added or modified later as well, so if you're not ready to create the roles that is ok.

=== API Key
In order to call the API at least one API key will need to be added. Additional API keys can be added at a later time by any user with the `admin` role.

=== Email Settings
This step is optional but it is recommended. Until Passport has been configured with a valid SMTP configuration Passport will be unable to send
email. This means features such as Forgot Password, Change Password, Verify Email and User Actions configured to send emails will not function.
