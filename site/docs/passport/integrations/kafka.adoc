== Overview

https://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] is a scalable messaging platform. This integration allows you to consume Webhook Events
using a Kafka Topic in addition to or instead of consuming the JSON events directly from a configured Webhook.

== Configuration

The Kafka integration may be enabled using the link:../apis/integrations[Integrations] API or through the Passport UI by navigating
to `Settings` -> `Integrations`.
