This guide will assist you with installing Passport Fronntend on your own server running Linux, Mac OS, or Windows.

== Download the Packages

Log into your https://www.inversoft.com/account[Inversoft account] and click Download. Find the Passport Frontend package for your target platform.

== Red Hat

To install on a Red Hat based system, use the RPM bundle. Execute this command to install the Passport Frontend RPM (replace `<version>` with
 the correct version number):
[source,shell]
----
$ sudo rpm -i passport-frontend<version>.rpm
----

To install on a Debian based system, use the DEB bundle. Execute this command to install the Passport Frontend DEB (replace `<version>` with
 the correct version number):

[source,shell]

$ sudo dpkg -i passport-frontend<version>.deb
----

== Mac OS X

To install on Mac OS use the ZIP bundle. Extract the Passport Frontend ZIP file anywhere on the file system. Remember where you extract the file.
 This location will be referred to as `PASSPORT_HOME`. We suggest extracting this file to a directory such as `/usr/local/inversoft`.

[NOTE]
====
You can install Passport in any directory including your home directory. This is a good choice for development machines or when you don't have
 or want to use sudo to install Passport.
====

Once the zip bundle has been extracted, the directory structure should look similar to this. If you installed somewhere other the default `PASSPORT_HOME`,
 your directory structure will be different, this is only for shown as an example.

[source,shell]
----
/usr/local/inversoft/config
/usr/local/inversoft/config/keystore
/usr/local/inversoft/config/passport.properties
/usr/local/inversoft/passport-frontend
----

== Windows

To install on Windows 7 or higher use the ZIP bundle. Extract the Passport Frontend ZIP file anywhere on the file system. Remember where you extract
 the file. This location will be referred to as `PASSPORT_HOME`. We suggest extracting this file to a directory such as `C:\inversoft` on Windows.

Once the zip bundle has been extracted, the directory structure should look similar to this. If you installed somewhere other the default `PASSPORT_HOME`,
 your directory structure will be different, this is only for shown as an example.

[source,shell]
----
C:\inversoft\config
C:\inversoft\config\keystore
C:\inversoft\config\passport.properties
C:\inversoft\passport-frontend\
----

Next, install the Windows service by changing to the directory designated as `PASSPORT_HOME` and then running the install command.

[source,shell]
----
C:\> cd C:\inversoft\passport-frontend\apache-tomcat\bin
C:\inversoft\passport-frontend\apache-tomcat\bin> PassportFrontend.exe /install
----

== Start Passport Frontend

Next, you need to start Passport Frontend. Use the instructions below to start Passport. Passport Frontend depends on the Passport Backend,
 Passport Backend should be started first.


[source,shell]
.Linux (RPM or DEB package)
----
$ sudo service passport-frontend start
----

[source,shell]
.Mac OS X (ZIP package)
----
$ <PASSPORT_HOME>/passport-frontend/apache-tomcat/bin/startup.sh
----

[source,shell]
.Windows (ZIP package)
----
C:\inversoft\passport-frontend\apache-tomcat\bin>startup.bat
----

[source,shell]
.Windows Service
----
C:\> net start PassportFrontend
----

== Maintenance Mode

You will access Passport Frontend's Maintenance Mode setup via the browser. If you installed Passport Frontend on your local machine, you'll access this interface by opening http://localhost:9031 in your browser. If Passport is running on a remote server, change the server name in the URL to match your server's name.

The first step of Maintenance Mode will prompt you to enter your license Id. You can retrieve your license Id from the Inversoft website by logging into your account here: https://www.inversoft.com/account/

You should see a screen that looks like this:

image::maintenance-mode-license.png[Maintenance Mode Enter License Id,width=900,role=shadowed]

Your license Id will be written out to the Passport configuration file in case you need to change it in the future.

The next step of Maintenance Mode will be to enter the location of your Passport Backend server and an API key. If you haven't created an API key yet, you must first log into Passport Backend and create an API key.

Here is the screen that asks for this information:

image::maintenance-mode-backend.png[Maintenance Mode Backend Connection,width=900,role=shadowed]

After you hit submit, you should see a screen that indicates that Passport is starting. After this screen disappears, Passport Frontend will be fully installed, configured and running.

== Advanced Installation

These instructions will assist you in editing the Passport Frontend configuration file via the command-line. If you used Maintenance Mode to configure Passport Frontend, you can skip this section.

=== Configuration

Before starting Passport Frontend for the first time, you'll need to add your license Id and Passport Backend URL and API key in the the Passport configuration. The name of this file is `passport.properties`.

The configuration file may be found in the following directory, assuming you installed in the default locations. If you have installed in an alternate location, the path to this file will be different.

Windows::
  `C:\inversoft\config`

Mac OS X or Linux::
  `/usr/local/inversoft/config`

For more information about the other configuration options found in this file, see the link:../reference/configuration[Configuration Reference] section.

Find the license Id field at the top of this configuration file and enter your license Id. You can find your License Id by logging into your account at https://www.inversoft.com/account/.

[source,ini]
.License Id
----
license.id=
----

Find the Passport Backend URL and API key properties and put in the correct URL and API for your Passport Backend installation.

[source,ini]
.Passport Backend
----
passport-frontend.backend-base-url=http://localhost:9011
passport-frontend.backend-api-key=
----

Passport Frontend should now be configured and ready to run. You can start Passport Frontend using the instructions in the <<Start Passport Frontend>> section above.
