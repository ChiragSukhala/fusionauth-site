== Overview

The core of Passport is a set of RESTful APIs that allow you to quickly integrate login, registration and advanced User management features into your application.

The Passport web UI (Passport Backend) is built upon these APIs, with the exception of managing API keys everything in the UI is available through an API. If you need
assistance with any of these APIs please send us a note at support@inversoft.com so we can help.
