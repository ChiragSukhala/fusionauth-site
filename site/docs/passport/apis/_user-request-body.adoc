must first disable Two Factor authentication and re-enable with a new delivery type.

See the link:../apis/two-factor#enable-two-factor[Enable Two Factor] and link:../apis/two-factor#disable-two-factor[Disable Two Factor] APIs
as an alternative to performing this action using the User API.

|[field]#user.twoFactorSecret# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The secret used to generate Two Factor verification codes.

You may optionally use value provided in the `secret` field returned by the link:../apis/two-factor#generate-a-secret[Two Factor Secret] API
instead of generating this value yourself.

Unless you are using `TextMessage` as your delivery type, ensure you are able to share the secret with the User before enabling Two Factor authentication.
Beginning in version 1.17.0, if you do create a User with `TextMessage` set as the `twoFactorDelivery` type and you omit this value, the secret will
be generated for you. The secret can be generated because it is not necessary to share the secret with the User for this delivery method.

When using `None` as the `twoFactorDelivery` this value will be required.

ifeval::["{http_method}" == "PUT"]
If Two Factor authentication is already enabled for this user, the secret may not be modified. In order to change the secret you
must first disable Two Factor authentication and re-enable with a new secret.
endif::[]

|[field]#user.username# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#

Once available use the `changePasswordId` parameter on the <<start-forgot-password-workflow,Start Forgot Password Workflow>> API to provide your own `changePasswordId`.
This field has been removed in version `1.19.0`.
