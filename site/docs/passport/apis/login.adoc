== Overview

This page contains the APIs that are used to authenticate and track user logins.

* <<Authenticate a User>>
* <<Complete Two Factor Authentication>>
* <<Update Login Instant>>
* <<Logout a User>>


== Authenticate a User

The Login API is used authenticate a user in Passport.

=== Request

link:authentication#no-authentication-required[icon:unlock-alt[role=green]] Authenticate a User.

.Request Headers
|===
|[field]#X-Forwarded-For# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The IP address of a client requesting authentication. If the IP address is provided it will be stored for login history of the user. It is
generally preferred to specify the IP address in the request body. If it is not provided in the request body this header value will be used
if available, the request body value will take precedence.
|===

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Request Body
|===
|[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#
|The Id of the Application the user is to be logged into. If this parameter is omitted the user will still be authenticated but a login
count will not be recorded for an Application.

|[field]#device# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available Since 1.6.2#
|The unique device identifier for this request.

Use this parameter to cause a refresh token cookie will be written to the client on the response named `refresh_token`
and it will also be provided in the response body. This value should be unique to the device and the same device id
should be sent on subsequent requests for the same device.

|[field]#email# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [deprecated]#Deprecated#
|The email address of the user to be logged in. Once available, use `loginId` instead.

|[field]#ipAddress# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available Since 1.8.0#
|The IP address of the end-user that is logging into Passport. If this value is omitted Passport will attempt to obtain the IP address of
the client, the value will be that of the `X-Forwarded-For` header if provided or the last proxy that sent the request. The IP address will
be stored in the User login history.

|[field]#loginId# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required# [since]#Available Since 1.4.0#
|The login identifier of the user. The login identifier can be either the `email` or the `username`.

|[field]#metaData.device.description# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available Since 1.6.2#
|A human readable description of the device represented by the `device` parameter.

|[field]#metaData.device.lastAccessedAddress# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available Since 1.6.2#
|The IP address of this login request.

|[field]#metaData.device.name# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available Since 1.6.2#
|A human readable name of the device represented by the `device` parameter.

|[field]#metaData.device.type# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available Since 1.6.2#
|The type of device represented by the `device` parameter. The following types may be specified:

* `BROWSER`
* `DESKTOP`
* `LAPTOP`
* `MOBILE`
* `OTHER`
* `SERVER`
* `TABLET`
* `TV`
* `UNKNOWN`

|[field]#noJWT# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`# [since]#Available Since 1.14.0#
|When this value is set to true a JWT will not be issued as part of this request. The response body will not contain the `token` field, and the `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies will not be written to the HTTP response.

This optional parameter may be helpful when performing high volume authentication requests and the JWT is not being utilized, in this scenario removing the additional latency required to issue and sign the JWT may have a measurable cumulative effect on performance.

|[field]#password# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The user's password or an Application specific link:../tutorials/authentication-tokens[Authentication Token].

|[field]#twoFactorTrustId# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required# [since]#Available Since 1.19.0#
|The Two Factor Trust identifier returned by the Two Factor Login API response. This value be may be provided to bypass the Two Factor challenge when a User has Two Factor enabled.

|[field]#username# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [deprecated]#Deprecated#
|The username of the user to be logged in. Once available, use `loginId` instead.

== Update Login Instant

Sends a ping to Passport indicating that the user was automatically logged into an application. When using Passport's SSO or your own, you
should call this if the user is already logged in centrally, but accesses an application where they no longer have a session. This helps
