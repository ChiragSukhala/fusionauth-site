Omitting this value indicates the password is in plain text and it will be encrypted using the default password encryptor.

[WARNING]
====
Importing users with plain text passwords is very slow because Passport will hash each one using the default scheme. Grab some popcorn and catch a movie it can take up to several hundred milliseconds per user.

The following encryptors are provided with Passport:

* `link:../reference/password-encryptors#salted-md5[salted-md5]`

* `link:../reference/password-encryptors#salted-bcrypt[bcrypt]`

If you don't see the scheme needed for importing your existing password you can also create your own password encryptor or we can build it for you. See the link:../plugins/password-encryptors[Password Encryptors] section for more information.

When using `TextMessage` the User will also need a valid `mobilePhone`.

|[field]#users``[x]``.twoFactorEnabled# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional#
|Determines if the User has two factor authentication enabled for their account or not.

See the link:../apis/two-factor#enable-two-factor[Enable Two Factor] and link:../apis/two-factor#disable-two-factor[Disable Two Factor] APIs
as an alternative to performing this action using the User API.

|[field]#users``[x]``.twoFactorSecret# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The secret used to generate Two Factor verification codes.

You may optionally use value provided in the `secret` field returned by the link:../apis/two-factor#generate-a-secret[Two Factor Secret] API
instead of generating this value yourself.

Unless you are using `TextMessage` as your delivery type, ensure you are able to share the secret with the User before enabling Two Factor authentication.
Beginning in version 1.17.0, if you do create a User with `TextMessage` set as the `twoFactorDelivery` type and you omit this value, the secret will
be generated for you. The secret can be generated because it is not necessary to share the secret with the User for this delivery method.

When using `None` as the `twoFactorDelivery` this value will be required.

|[field]#users``[x]``.username# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The username of the User.

|[field]#users``[x]``.usernameStatus# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `ACTIVE`#
|
include::_moderation_status_request.adoc[]

|[field]#validateDbConstraints# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`# [since]#Available Since 1.9.4#
|Set this value to `true` in order to perform additional validation of the request.

The import request is intended to be used to populate the initial set of users, this means Passport does not expect to find duplicate users in the database. If a duplicate is encountered a `500` will be returned without this additional validation.

If you intend to use this API with existing users in Passport set this value to `true` to request additional validation be performed on the input request
and a `400` response will be returned with JSON body indicating the duplicate values encountered.

Setting this value to `true` will dramatically decrease the performance of this request. If importing large numbers of users in a single request you may need
to increase request timeouts to ensure this request does not timeout before it has completed.
