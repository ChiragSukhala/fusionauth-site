== Configuration Reference

Much of the Passport configuration is performed in the Passport Backend management interface. Some additional advanced configuration is provided through a configuration file. You may modify this file in order to change your configuration, Passport will need to be restarted to pick up changes to this configuration. Assuming you installed in the default locations, the configuration file may be found in the following directory. If you have installed in an alternate location the path to this file will be different.

[.command-line]
.Linux and Mac OS X

[.command-line]
.Windows

|===
|[field]#license.id# [type]#[String]#
|Your License Id. You can find your License Id by logging into your https://www.inversoft.com/account[Inversoft account]. This value is generally automatically set during startup maintenance mode.

|[field]#database.url# [type]#[String]#
|The JDBC connection URL to your database. The following are example values.

- Example MySQL URL: `database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/passport?serverTimezone=UTC`
- Example PostgreSQL URL: `database.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/passport`

If you are using MySQL, you must include the `serverTimezone=UTC` parameter in the URL. The `?` character is the same as a standard URL parameter, so if you have additional parameters, you should only have a single `?` and parameters should be separated by `&`.

|[field]#database.username# [type]#[String]#
|The username used to connect to the database.

|[field]#database.password# [type]#[String]#
|The password used to connect to the database.

|[field]#database.mysql.enforce-utf8mb4# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `true`#
|When set to `true` and using MySQL, full 4 byte unique configuration is enforced at startup.

If this validation is not desired or not it is not possible to modify your MySQL configuration so satisfy the validation, disable this check
by setting this value to `false`.

|[field]#passport-search-engine.transport-port# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `9020`#
|The port that the search engine will use for optimized TCP communications instead of HTTP communications. This port is used internally by the search engine to communicate between clustered nodes.

|[field]#passport-search-engine.http-port# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `9021`#
|The port number that the Search Engine will use to accept HTTP requests. This value is also utilized by Passport Backend to make HTTP
requests to the Passport Search Engine.

|[field]#passport-search-engine.memory# [type]#[String (Memory)]# [default]#defaults to `256M`#
|
include::docs/passport/reference/_property-memory.adoc[]

|[field]#passport-search-engine.additional-java-args# [type]#[String]#
|
include::docs/passport/reference/_property-additional-jvm-args.adoc[]

|[field]#passport-search-engine.hosts# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `\_local_`#
|This parameter indicates which address or network interfaces to bind during service startup. The default value will cause the service to bind  any
loopback address on the system such as `127.0.0.1`.

This default value is sufficient for running Passport Backend and the Search Engine on the same server. If you run the Search Engine on a separate system than
Passport Backend you will need to modify this value. You may specify a single hostname or IP address or one of the special values in any combination.

Special values include:

* `\_[networkInterface]_` - Addresses of a network interface, for example `\_en0_`
* `\_local_` - Any loopback address on the system, for example `127.0.0.1`
* `\_site_` - Any site-local addresses on the system, for example `192.168.0.1`.
* `\_global_` - Any globally-scoped addresses on the system, for example `8.8.8.8`.

The following is an example to bind to `localhost` as well as any site local addresses on the system such at `192.168.1.42`.

[block-quote]#`passport-search-engine.hosts=\_local_,\_site_`#

|[field]#passport-search-engine.servers# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `localhost:9020`#
|A comma separated list of stand-alone search engine servers that will be used by Passport. The port specified on the server should be the
Search Engine Transport port, not the HTTP port.

The following is an example of a configuration for two separate search engines, one running on localhost and the other is on remote system.

[block-quote]#`passport-search-engine.servers=localhost:9020,search2.example.com:9020`#

This configuration value is used by the Passport Search Engine and the Passport Backend services. Even when running Passport Backend without
Passport Search Engine on the same server this configuration value will need to be provided.

|[field]#passport-search-engine.data-directory# [type]#[String (Path)]#
|The location on disk where Passport Search Engine will store its data. This value is defaulted if not specified and generally should not be modified.

|[field]#passport-backend.public-url# [type]#[String]#
|The Passport backend URL that is used to communicate with other Passport nodes. This value is defaulted if not specified and generally should
not be modified. Passport will attempt to use a localhost address or a site local if available. Unless you have multiple Passport nodes the
generated value should always work. You may need to manually specify this value if you have multiple Passport nodes and the only way the nodes
can communicate is on a public network.

|[field]#passport-backend.search-engine-servers# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `http://localhost:9021`# [since]#Available Since 1.19.0#
|A comma separated list of URLS that will be used by Passport backend to connect to the search engine. The port specified on the URL should
be the Search Engine HTTP port. (see `passport-search-engine.http-port`) It is not recommended to ever run the Passport Search Engine open
to the public internet.

Generally this should be the same list provided by `passport-search-engine.servers` except this list will be a list of URLs and this value
is utilized by the Passport backend webservice. If this property is not defined it will be generated based upon the value of `passport-search-engine.servers`.

The following is an example of a configuration for two separate search engines, one running on localhost and the other is on a remote system.

[block-quote]#`passport-backend.search-engine-servers=http://localhost:9021,http://search2.example.com:9021`#

|[field]#passport-backend.management-port# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `9010`#
|The port number used for internal Tomcat administration.

|[field]#passport-backend.http-port# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `9011`#
|The port number that Passport will use to accept HTTP requests.

|[field]#passport-backend.https-port# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `9013`#
|The port number that Passport will use to accept HTTPS requests.

|[field]#passport-backend.ajp-port# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `9019`#
|The port number that Passport will use to accept AJP requests.

|[field]#passport-backend.memory# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `256M`#
|

|[field]#passport-frontend.management-port# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `9030`# [deprecated]#Deprecated#
|The port number used for internal Tomcat administration.

|[field]#passport-frontend.http-port# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `9031`# [deprecated]#Deprecated#
|The port number that Passport frontend will use to accept HTTP requests.

|[field]#passport-frontend.https-port# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `9033`# [deprecated]#Deprecated#
|The port number that Passport frontend will use to accept HTTPS requests.

|[field]#passport-frontend.backend-base-url# [type]#[String (URL)]# [default]#defaults to `http://localhost:9011`# [deprecated]#Deprecated#
|The root URL for your Passport Backend server that will handle requests from the Passport Frontend. This should not include any path unless your Passport Backend is running under a context path. This value is generally set for you by the Passport Frontend maintenance mode.

For example, the following assumes that Passport Backend is running on the same server and is using the default port configuration:

[block-quote]#`passport-frontend.backend-base-url=http://localhost:9011`#

|[field]#passport-frontend.backend-api-key# [type]#[String]# [deprecated]#Deprecated#
|The API key the front end will use to make calls to the backend services. If you need to change the default value ensure you make the corresponding change to the API keys as defined in the Passport Backend. This value is generally set for you by the Passport Frontend maintenance mode.

|[field]#passport-frontend.memory# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `256M`# [deprecated]#Deprecated#
|
include::docs/passport/reference/_property-memory.adoc[]

|[field]#passport-frontend.additional-java-args# [type]#[String]# [deprecated]#Deprecated#
|
include::docs/passport/reference/_property-additional-jvm-args.adoc[]

|[field]#passport-frontend.theme# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to default# [deprecated]#Deprecated#
|Specifies the name of the frontend theme. If this value is not specified the default theme will be used which resides in the following directory `/web/themes/default`.
